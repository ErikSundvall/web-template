# web-templates

Currently, we are in the process of releasing ehr-common artefact to the maven central repository. 
Until that release is done, this project has a dependency on a SNAPSHOT version of the ehr-common. 
If you want to build web templates, you need to build ehr-common locally. 
You can obtain its source code from [https://github.com/better-care/ehr-common](https://github.com/better-care/ehr-common).
